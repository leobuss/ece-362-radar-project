# Turn on this project's git hooks, once, at build time.
#
# Git will not let a repository install its own hooks - cloning would otherwise
# run its code - so somebody has to point git at .githooks. Doing it here means
# it happens the first time you build and you never have to think about it.
#
# The hooks themselves stay quiet: the pre-commit hook only speaks up if
# confirmation.txt looks wrong (see .githooks/pre-commit).
#
# Nothing in here can stop your project building. Every failure is swallowed:
# no git, no repository, a read-only checkout, or being unpacked somewhere
# without .githooks at all - in each case this does nothing and says nothing.
